# ChessAIZero ♟️

ChessAIZero is a Python-based chess engine project featuring multiple AI strategies including:
- Greedy AI
- MinMax AI
- MinMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Random AI

Each AI attempts to simulate different decision-making logic in chess, making it useful for learning and experimenting with game AI.

## 📁 NOTE
- This project is heavy underdeveloped. I would like to visit back to this project when I get more time.
- A lot of bugs espically in the ABTesting folder.
- My MinMax isn't the most effecient yet. I believe it is still missing Null Move Prunning and a Transposition Table.
